# NetworkCommunities1_0
Fuzzy communities detection software for complex networks

NetworkCommunities version 1.0 is distributed using three different directories. The 
package and code is contained in the NetworkCommunities1_0_Source directory. There, you 
will found the source code and the GNU General Public License. The html documentation 
for the package is contained in a compressed file (html_doc.zip) in the doc directory.  
To access the documentation just unpack the file and double click the 
NetworkCommunities1_0Doc.html file. This will open the whole documentation 
in your default web browser. Finally, the example directory contains the source code 
and data for the example described in the documentation. It is strongly encouraged 
to try this example, both in the sequential and parallel versions, until you make it 
run correctly. That is the best way to familarize yourself with the structure of 
the NetworkCommunity package.
